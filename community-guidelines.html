  <h1>Team Minus Community Guidelines</h1>
  <p>
    As our community continues to grow bigger, it is now important to set up guidelines that each member shall
    follow, including our team members and moderators.
    These guidelines are to be respected at all times in all places that our community members can interact with
    each other. This includes but is not limited to:
    our Discord and Minecraft servers and the comments spaces under posts on our social media like X (Twitter),
    Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Bluesky, Mastodon and Facebook.<br>
    If you happen to have any question about these guidelines, for example if you need clarification, feel free to
    contact us at <a href="mailto:mc.teamminus@gmail.com">mc.teamminus@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Last revision: 02 Nov 2025, 15:41 CET<br>
    We assume every community member is aware of these guidelines. They will be informed of any changes made to them
    by announcements on our social media.<br>
    What we define as a "community member" is someone present on our Discord server or someone that commented on any
    content we posted on social media.<br>
    What we define as a "team member" is someone that helped or is actively contributing to one or multiple projects
    of Team Minus. Most, but not all, of them are present in the Team Minus Discord server and have the @Contributor
    role. Thus, all team members are community members and are subject to these guidelines as well.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2>Guidelines</h2>
  <b>First and foremost, use common sense.</b>
  <h3>I. Shared content must be appropriate for everyone.</h3>
  <p>
    This community is partly composed of minors. Content you share, no matter if it is just messages or if it
    includes media, must be appropriate to see for children. Basically, NSFW content is prohibited (graphic
    violence, nudity, profanity, slurs, or other potentially disturbing content), but also anything that isn't
    suitable for a minor to see or read.
  </p>
  <h3>II. Social and political discussions</h3>
  <p>
    We understand that members may want to discuss social or political topics. Because our team is a small volunteer
    project with limited moderation capacity, public debates are allowed only when they remain respectful,
    evidence‑based, and focused on ideas rather than personal attacks. Please follow these simple rules:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep tone respectful and avoid insults, name‑calling, or targeting people or groups.</li>
    <li>Avoid organising or escalating heated debates in general chat. Prefer dedicated channels (if available) or
      direct messages.</li>
    <li>If a discussion becomes abusive or repeatedly derails, moderators may remove messages, ask participants to
      continue privately, or apply standard moderation.</li>
    <li>If you are unsure whether a topic is appropriate for a public channel, default to moving it to DMs or asking
      a moderator first.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>III. Harassment, hateful speech, and discriminatory content</h3>
  <p>
    Team Minus is neutral on political views, but not on human condition. Harassment, threats, or content that
    promotes hatred,
    discrimination, or violence against people based on their characteristics (physical traits, religion, gender
    identity, sexual orientation, disability, nationality, etc.) is strictly prohibited. This includes slurs,
    praising violence, dehumanising language, and targeted harassment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reasonable, contextual discussion or quoting (for critique, reporting, or academic purposes) is allowed only if
    the intent is clear and the content is not used to promote or normalise hateful ideas. When in doubt, provide
    context or move the
    conversation to DMs. Moderators may remove content and take action when rules are broken.
  </p>
  <h3>IV. Respect each other.</h3>
  <p>
    We do not want to be restrictive, we don't aim to prevent people from sharing things. We try to be pretty
    relaxed about this, and will mostly be joking the same way as you, with you. Let's keep things that way by
    respecting each other, making use of common sense and not crossing the line.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2>Additional Information</h2>
  <h3>Platforms guidelines</h3>
  <p>
    Each service we use has its own Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, or equivalent. Make sure to follow
    them as well. We will report you to the concerned platform(s) if needed in order for them to take action.
  </p>
  <h3>Sanctions</h3>
  <p>Sanctions are handled case-by-case, taking into account:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The severity of the rule break</li>
    <li>Context and intent</li>
    <li>Previous incidents</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Actions can range from warnings to temporary restrictions to permanent bans. Serious violations may result in
    sanctions across all Team Minus platforms. The final decision on sanctions remains at the moderators'
    discretion.
  </p>
  <h3>Team Minus Moderation and Contact</h3>
  <p>
    Our moderators are volunteers, trying to maintain the community safe for everyone. We currently do not take
    applications.<br>
    Contact the team at <a href="mailto:mc.teamminus@gmail.com">mc.teamminus@gmail.com</a>, by pinging or DMing a
    @Moderator on the Discord server, or DMing us on our socials.<br>
